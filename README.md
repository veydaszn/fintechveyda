Project Overview
FinTechVeyda is a user-friendly, integrated web application designed to streamline financial operations for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Kenya. This project addresses the critical challenges Kenyan SMEs face in managing cash flow, invoicing, payroll, and expense tracking, which often hinder their growth and access to working capital.

Our solution aims to provide an accessible and intuitive platform tailored to the local market, with a strong focus on M-Pesa integration, recognizing its pervasive role in Kenya's financial landscape. This initiative aligns with the conference theme of "Innovative Pathways to Inclusive Education: Advancing Knowledge, Technology, and Sustainable Development" by fostering financial literacy and operational efficiency within the SME sector.

Key Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

Comprehensive Dashboard: A clear overview of key financial metrics (Total Revenue, Total Expenses, Net Cash Flow).

Financial Trends Visualization: An interactive chart displaying income vs. expenses over a period.

M-Pesa Transaction Recording: An intuitive form for manual input of M-Pesa transaction codes, amounts, types (income/expense), and descriptions. This lays the groundwork for future automated API integration.

Basic Navigation: Ability to switch between Dashboard, Transactions, and Reports views.

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Technical Stack
The application leverages modern web technologies for a scalable, secure, and responsive user experience:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

Charting Library: Chart.js

Icons: Font Awesome (for navigation and social media)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

(Note: The backend (Python/Node.js with PostgreSQL) is conceptualized in the abstract and database schema but not yet implemented in this frontend-only MVP.)
